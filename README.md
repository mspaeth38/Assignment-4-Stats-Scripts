# Assignment 4

## This is for BSGP7030 where we look at how to use Python statistics in Jupyter, using GitHub, and creating environments. Following the SciPy tutorial, we learned how to do various statistical tests including but not limited to: hypothesis testing while comparing two groups, t-tests, paired t-tests, linear regression models, multiple regression models, using seaborn for data visualization, and learning how to exclude certain variables in statistical tests. This information would be good for students learning how to code statistics with data files.
